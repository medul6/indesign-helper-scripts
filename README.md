InDesign Helper Scripts
=============

Description
-------


These are scripts for which I don't create individual repositories ...

* "FitDocToSelection" -- Fits the document to the current selection in the active document
* "GoToFirstTextOverflow" -- Jumps to the first found text overflow in the active document
* "GoToSamePageEveryDoc" -- Displays in every open document the same spread so you can cycle (cmd+<) through them
* "SnippetPositionChooser" -- Changes the Snippet paste position of every open document ("Ursprünglich"/"original location" or "Cursorposition"/"cursor location")


Disclaimer
-----
	Use my scripts at your own risk! I am not responsible for any damages to your InDesign Documents!
	With my Repositories I just want to give the world back what I have got from others who share their code – usable, productive AppleScripts!

Contributing
------------
Want to contribute? Great! You sure know what to do, I am new to Github so I don't know if I am doing this right :)

File-Formats
-----------
    Normally, in InDesign, I use the *.scpt format because it it precompiled but at the same time contains the code and is viewable via QuickLook. 
    I'm also commiting an *.applescript file, just because it it readable (If you just want to take a look) on github and the precompiled is not.
    They should be in sync, always.
    
Localization
-----------
    At the moment the script is mixed, english and german. with the documentation beeing mostly in english but most strings are in german.
    As far as I researched it is not trivial to localize AppleScripts. We (the studio I work in) use these scripts

Installation
-----------
	My scripts should work in a variety of InDesign Versions which is wy I use the Application ID instead of the name.
	But they should definitly work in the latest InDesign Version. We update our Adobe apps as soon as a new version comes out.
    Put the file in the application folder "Adobe InDesign CSx" > "Scripts" > "Scripts Panel"

Usage
-----
    open InDesign and some documents and start the script from the "Scripts Panel"
